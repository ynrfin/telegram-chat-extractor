# !! PRODUCT OF AI
It is result of ChatGPT. I dont really care, as long as it does it job good enough

# What is this
Telegram does not support getting updates from the start of a chatgroup for any bot. So if you want to get previous chats, I dont think they provide that

This little script would help you get those previous messages

## Minus
- I focus on text messages. it strips anchor from the hashtag, remove time and clearfix element
- no formatting for monospace or codeblock
- links uncleaned

Extend it as you need. We heve AI now
